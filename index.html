			<p style="font-size: x-large;">My name is Brandon Colbert.</p>
			<p style="font-size: large;">Currently, I'm a graduating senior Computer Science major attending Clemson University. There isn't much that I don't find interesting in the world of computing, but some of my favorite recent technologies are wearables, especially Virtual and Augmented Reality.</p>
			<p style="font-size: large;">Since one of my favorite hobbies is programming, I've made some applications in my quest to learn how. Some of my favorite (and personally most used) projects so far are my tab management extension from browsers, Tabs!, and my playlist generator, Noise.</p>
			<p style="font-size: large;">As of lately, I've been doing a lot of work in scripting languages like TypeScript and Lua. I have no plans of slowing down for the foreseeable future and as always:</p>
			<p style="font-size: large;">Functional is the goal, fabulous is the dream.</p>
