		<h2><u>Greetings!</u></h2>
		<section>
			<p>My name is Brandon Colbert.</p>
			<p>I'm a CS major/Physics minor who recently graduated from Clemson University with my Bachelor's of Science degree.</p>
			<p>There isn't much that I don't find interesting in the world of computing, but some of my favorite recent technologies are wearables, especially Virtual and Augmented Reality.</p>
			<p>Programming has remained as one of my favorite hobbies as far back as high school, so a lot of my free time goes towards making software to improve my craft and for fun.</p>
			<p>My favorite categories of software are utility and productivity which make doing the things you like easier and better. As such, some of my favorite (and personally most used) projects so far are my tab management extension for browsers, Tabs!, and my playlist generator, Noise.</p>

			<p>Outside of programming and eventually becoming a full stack dev, there are a couple of other things I'm highly interested in and am learning.</p>
			<p>To name a few:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>3D Modeling</li>
				<li>Drawing</li>
				<li>Animation</li>
				<li>3D Printing</li>
				<li>Cooking</li>
				<li>Japanese</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There's a lot that life has to offer and limited time to do it.</p>
			<p>I have no plans of slowing down for the foreseeable future and as always: functional is the goal, fabulous is the dream.</p>
