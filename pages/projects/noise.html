		<h1>Noise</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Noise is a desktop application to create playlists from online videos.</p>
			<p>
				Unlike traditional media players, Noise can compile videos from multiple web platforms into a single playlist.
				This is accomplished through a configurable, UI-driven pipeline system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Plugins are also supported to enable additional functionality, such as visualizers, pop-out players, or ad-block.
