		<h1>Formulas</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Formulas is a library used to perform calculations based on text formatted in math notation.</p>
			<p>Currently, Formulas fits two primary use cases.</p>
			<p>
				Firstly, it can serve as a backend for a calculator to solve expressions consisting of numeric constants.
				These expressions may include basic operations as well as exponentiation, modulo, and parenthetical grouping.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, it can enable user-defined implementations of certain computations in an application.
				This is achieved by writing a function in the text whose inputs are used as variables in the function's definition.
			</p>

				<h2>Main Features</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Solve expressions of consisting of constants</li>
					<li>Solve functions involving any number of variables</li>
					<li>Custom single-variable transformation functions such as sin, cos, and random</li>
					<li>Type declaration on function inputs</li>
					<li>Compilation of type specified functions to fast LINQ expressions</li>
				</ul>
