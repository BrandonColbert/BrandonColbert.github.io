		<h1>Antipodean Chess</h1>
		<section>
			<p>A spin on the classic take of chess.</p>
			<p>Rather than taking place on a board, this version uses a sphere.</p>
			<section>
				<p>There are two featured modes. Sphere and Antipodean.</p>
				<p>In sphere mode, the rules are the same as standard chess. However, columns A and H are considered adjacent.</p>
				<p>Antipodean mode introduces many new mechanics which are laid out below.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Axial Squares</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two axial squares. Alpha on the top of the sphere and Omega on the bottom of the sphere.</li>
						<li>Pieces located on these squares are allowed to begin their movements in the direction of any adjacent tiles.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Inversion</li>
					<ul>
						<li>An alternate board is located on the inside of the sphere. One can switch between which is in view freely.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Starting Pieces/Positions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There are four knights for each team on either side of the board.</li>
						<li>The king is located on the outer board on an axial tile while the queen is located on the same axial tile on the inner board.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Push/Send and Pull/Retrieve</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The queen can send pieces on her board to the relatively inverse board, placing them on the same square of the board inverse to the queen.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This can only take place if the other side is empty.</li>
							<li>A queen may not push herself.</li>
							<li>Another queen may push a different queen.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The king can retrieve pieces from the relatively inverse board,Â  placing them on the same square of the king's board.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This can only take place if the other side is empty.</li>
							<li>The King may not retrieve himself.</li>
							<li>If a queen is selected and located on the same square as the king on the board inverse to the king, they may be "swapped" in a single turn. This allows the king and queen to be placed on the same square of the board previously considered relatively inverse.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Either of these actions will end the turn.</li>
						<li>If done on a pawn, it will not count as the pawn's first move.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
