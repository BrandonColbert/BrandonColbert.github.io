			<p>Hello, my name is Brandon.</p>
			<p>Currently, I'm a sophmore Computer Science major attending Clemson University. There isn't much that I don't find interesting in the world of computing, but some of my favorite upcoming technologies are Virtual and Augmented Reality.</p>
			<p>Since one of my favorite hobbies is programming, I've made some applications in my quest to learn how. Functional is the goal, fabulous is the dream.</p>
